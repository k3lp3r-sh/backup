##### Dream Outcome -> This won't be financially worth it
##### Likelihood of Ach -> It won't work for me specifically. I won't be able to stick with it. External factors will get in my way.
##### Effort and Sacrifice -> This will be too hard, confusing and I won't like it. I will suck at it.
##### Time -> This will take too much time to do. I am too busy to do this. It won't be convenient for me.

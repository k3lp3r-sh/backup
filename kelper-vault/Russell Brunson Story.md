I once heard Russell Brunson tell a story about this concept. He explained how his wife, Collette, at first hearing about this status concept, rejected it. She claimed she wasnâ€™t driven by status and would never want to drive a Lamborghini. Instead, she favored her minivan. But, after talking further, she revealed it was because driving a Lamborghini would decrease her status amongst her mom friends, while driving a minivan would show she was a good 
mother (increase in status).

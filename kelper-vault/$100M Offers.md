# Chapter 1: How we got here.

Somehow, in the transition between “passionate to help others” and “owning my first business,” we gradually realized that we don’t even know the first thing about business, let alone turning a profit.

Succeeding in business means getting prospective customers to trade us money for our services.

The only way to facilitate that exchange, to transact, to literally carry out business as a business is by making the prospect an offer.

As you likely now know, I have crafted thousands of offers over the last decade. Most failed. Some did okay. And some struck gold . . . but I never really knew why

# Pricing: How to charge lots of money for stuff

### “Grow or Die”

```
  You have to keep growing in order to survive, a stagnating business, or a stagnating company always leads to a loss.
```

There are only three things that require for your company to grow,

1. Get More Clients
2. Increase the average price per purchase value
3. Get them to buy more times

### Business Terms

1. Gross Profit — ( The revenue - cost of servicing the customer ). This is not net profit, net profit is what is left out after all expenses are paid.
    
2. Lifetime Value — Total profits from a specific customer, i.e., (Gross profit x number of purchases)
    
    ```jsx
    Revenue: ($1,000/mo * 90% Gross Margin * 5 months) = $4,500 Lifetime Value (LTV)
    ```
    
    Indirect costs like admin, software rent etc. are not included in LTV (it is also same as LTGP Life Time Gross Profit)
    

### Value Driven vs Price Driven Purchases

Having a GrandSlam offer helps with all the three major requirements : getting more customers and getting more value out of existing customers (Making them purchase multiple times and higher cost of purchase) — This allows you to sell your product based on value not the price.

_Commoditized -_ Things that are sold based on the price. (Race to the bottom)

If a prospect looks at your product and compares it with a similar product from a competitor, and thinks “These are pretty much the same, I’ll buy the cheaper one” that means you’ve been commoditized!

_**********Differentiated -**********_ Things that are sold based on the value. (Sell in category of one with no comparison!)

# A Grand-Slam Offer

"It’s an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers . . . forever removing the cash constraint on business growth."

A unique offer that no one else can replicate, which on sales saturates all the demand towards you — it allows you to sell with zero competition, now, as in the above expression (for commoditization) there is no other competition for your prospect to compare you with. You can sell in whatever price you want.

Hence you get more customers, at higher ticket prices for less money out of your pocket.

### How a normal commoditized agency works;

They spend 10s of thousands in advertising to get customers, who would pay about half (at .5-1 return you lose money on bringing in customers)of the advertising spend. Then in the next month, assuming all customers stay, the net profit becomes 0, and in the third month, the agency has it’s first profitable month.

The expense on adverts is the same while there is a 2.5 times higher response to the advertisement, and a 2.5 times higher closing rate, at 4 times the price. This gives us 25 times as much cash collected, which would’ve first come from the 5 people who stayed for the normal agency for 22 months, each. Only then would such an amount be possible in a normal agency, hence, if you have a grand slam offer, it makes it so that you can make 23 months revenue of a normal agency in a single month. ******

_“Yup. You read that right. This is the part in the action movie where you walk away from an explosion in slow motion”_

# Pricing: Finding the Right Market — A Starving Crowd

“_At the end of the day, if there is a ton of demand for a solution, you can be mediocre at business, have a terrible offer, and have no ability to persuade people, and you can still make money.”_

— How do you pick the right market?

There is a market that desperately needs your abilities, and you need to find it. When you do, you will capitalize. Don’t be emotionally attached to your audience.
### 1. Massive Pain

You must have an offer and the prospects must, not want, but desperately need the offer like masks and sanitizers during covid.

_**“The Pain is the pitch”**_

They must have a problem that is extremely painful for them and we are the only ones they can turn to, to solve the problem.

The point of good writing is for the reader to **********understand**********

The point of good persuasion is for the prospect to feel _understood_

### 2. Purchasing Power

There is no point in solving a problem for someone, who cannot pay for your services. You can be

They might be in massive pain and it might be a huge starving market, but the reason they are a huge starving market that no one else has taken advantage of is because they have some issue in them.

Again, not every market is like this but, most of them ********could be.******** Make sure your targets have good access to the amount of money needed to avail your services.

### 3. Easy to Target

The market must be easy to target. We should get money from getting clients, not losing money. This is a grand-slam offer, not a regular agency type shit, you won’t get recurring payments form your clients to do your work.

If it seems like you would be spending way more money than what you get in return from the clients, then you are on the losing side, meaning that there is no profits to be made.

You want to make sure you can reach your targets easily, cheaply and effectively.

### 4. Growing

Money is speed.

Money is always present in the market that is growing at an high pace.

Declining markets make all efforts harder. While Growing markets make everything move faster.

What are the most fundamental things, without which we can’t live on → there are three markets that will always exist.

Health, Wealth and Relationships

The reason this will always exist is that there is a tremendous pain when you do not have them. Problems always exist in these three domains of life, meaning there are always problems here.

Which translates to — there is always a demand for solutions to the problems in these niches.

---

### Starving Crowd > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills

these are the three pillars of a grand-slam offer.

---

You cannot always be in a dying or a great market. We’ll most likely be in a normal market.

You just aren’t supposed to be in a ‘bad’ market, or nothing else will work.

************************************Commit to the Niche.************************************

Most of the markets are good markets, they are neither bad nor great.

committing completely to a niche will make you more profits than being in a generic market.

Most generic markets are saturated.

The actual program might be the same generic $19 course, but since the learning from the course is applied into a niche, the price has driven up.

_You want to be ‘the guy’ who services ‘this type of person’ or solves ‘this type of problem’_

---

So for a varied example case. If there is a fitness program designed for anyone and everyone, it might not have much value. But if you get the time slots during which a doctor/nurse is free and made a program for the specific person, then, all four tenets of markets are satisfied

1. Fat = Pain
2. Nurses / Doctors make a tonne of money
3. Easy to target, they’re just fat nurses and doctors.
4. Obesity rates are at an all time high now, so it’s a growing market.

### Summary

1. Don’t pick a bad market, a normal market is fine and if you stumble upon a great market, then it’s great. There is a lot of profit that can be made even from the normal markets.
2. If we try 100 offers, at least 1 will succeed.
3. Nothing can stop you if you pair a Grand-Slam offer with a great market.

Have this skill set — the ability to accurately assess markets by taking into account pain money targeting and growth.

# Pricing

_“Charge as high a price as you can say out loud without cracking a smile”_

## Price-Value Discrepancy
"*I hope what you're giving them is worth it*"

Those are the words that would make you question whether what you're doing is the right thing.

So how do we create and convey the value or "Worth-it-ness"?

The reason people buy anything is to get a deal, they believe that by getting a deal for something, they are getting a value that is worth more than what they are paying you. If the value they receive drops below what they are paying you, then they instantly stop buying from you.

*"Price is what you pay, Value is what you get"*

--

Now, the simplest way to increase the gap between price and value is by lowering the price, and most of the time, it's the wrong decision a business can take.

Getting people to buy at any cost isn't the objective of a business, making money is. That's where the Grand-Slam offer kicks in, it would help more people say yes at a higher price by increasing our value to price discrepancy. 

The goal of a Grand-Slam offer is to get more people to say yes at a higher price by increasing the value you provide. we will raise out price only after we have sufficiently increased our value. This way, it would be a great deal for them too, it's like getting $100,000 dollars for $10,000. 
	"*It's money at a discount*"
Most business owners take a conventional price based marketing approach.
1. They look at the marketplace
2. See what everyone else offers
3. Take the average, and go slightly below that
4. Provide a little more than what their competitors offer
And these *competitors* from whom they copy are dead broke. 
*There is no advantage at being the second cheapest, but there is for being the most expensive*

Competition on the price is eventually going to push your head underwater. 
#### We are trying to make the most money, not get the most customers

![[2023-10-03-145108_651x772_scrot.png]]
When you decrease the price, 
1. your clients don't care about the product/service/investment that much since it didn't cost them much.
2. The value in the eyes of the clients go down, "it can't be that good if it is that cheap."
3. The clients do not value your service
4. Attract the worst clients who are never satisfied until your service is free.
5. Destroy any extra margin to hire the best people for the service, pamper your clients, invest in growth, scale up your business.
Instead, with an increased price,
1. Your clients are more emotionally invested in you
2. The value that they see in your product/service/investment goes up
3. Getting results become easier because they are more interested and value your service.
4. Attract the best clients who are the easiest to satisfy, and cost less to fulfill
5. More opportunities to pursue with increased margins and scaling up
People *want* to buy expensive things, they just need a reason for it. 
Raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. 

*"The goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, 'This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here'"*

99% of the businesses need to raise their prices to grow, not lower them. Profit is oxygen, it fuels the fire of growth. It is necessary to reach more people and make a bigger impact.

To charge that much, we need to also provide tremendous value to the clients.
# Value Offer : The Value Equation
Anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can charge these rates and get people to say yes.

you should never charge someone more than what your product is worth, but you must charge them way more than what it takes to fulfill it... not just two or three times more, more like a hundred times more.
Pharma companies take only pennies to manufacture their tablets, but they charge 100s of dollars for their products.

If the client gets enough for the offer, anything would be a fair offer, or a 'steal'

value unleashes the unlimited pricing and profit power to scale your company.

### The Value Equation

![[Pasted image 20231004163646.png]]

4 key factors controlling value
1. Dream Outcome -- to be increased
2. Perceived likelihood of Achievement -- to be increased
3. Time delay -- to be decreased
4. Efforts and Sacrifice -- to be decreased

1. What will I make?
2. How will I know it's going to happen?
3. How long will it take?
4. What is expected of me [client]

### Getting the bottom to zero

In the top side of the equation, beginner marketers make bigger and bigger claims, it's easy and it's lazy. these claims are the easiest to establish and are hence less unique. 

Reducing the Time Delay and Effort n Sacrifice is harder and more competitive.

- Amazon made purchasing a single click of a button and made them arrive almost immediately
- Netflix made consuming television immediate and effortless.
Generally, the market rewards you more for concentrating on reducing the friction more on the bottom of the equation.

*"Given this postulate, a prospect would (in theory) purchase something from you, and the moment their credit card was run, it would immediately become their reality. That is infinite value"*


### Perception is Reality
It's not about how much you reduce the bottom of the equation or increase the top, if the prospect doesn't feel that this might work, then the value added is 0.
![[Pasted image 20231006141817.png]]

## # Dream Outcome (To be increased)
The dream outcome is the gap between a person's reality and their dreams, we have to accurately depict that dream and show them that we understand them and how we can get them there.

ex., someone might want to be perceived as beautiful -> and there are a lot of vehicles that can get them there, like make up, supplements, plastic surgery, fitness etc... but why do they want to be perceived as beautiful? it might be because of a deeper desire to achieve higher status in one's own social group.

[[other examples of Dream Outcomes]]

It's not about the money, it's about the status. In most cases money *buys* status, but in some cases, it might be the opposite. refer [[Russell Brunson Story]] 

Talk in terms of things that your prospect believes will increase their status, and they'll be drooling.

With all of them considered, if two products give the same outcome, they will cancel out and the value depends on the other three variables.

## # Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (to be increased)

People pay for certainty -> they value certainty.

"How likely do I believe it that I will achieve the result I am looking for if I make this purchase?"

## # Time Delay (to be decreased)

the shorter the distance between when they purchase and they receive the value/the outcome, the more valuable your service or product is.

1. Long-term outcome
2. Short-term experience

People buy the long-term outcome, but what makes them long enough to get to that point is the short-term experience

**After someone buys your product, an emotional win is a must if possible. it helps the customer see through, and tell themselves that what they did was the correct thing.**

eg. for a weight loss customer, get them to meet someone else so they immediately had some social benifits from the program, and give them a much more aggressive diet in the beginning. When someone experience a victory early on, they are more likely to continue with something than those who do not.

### Efforts and sacrifice (To be decreased)

Decreasing the effort and sacrifice or atleast increasing the perceived value is a pillar around which the offer is made.

The end-outcome might be the same, but most people in this gen are pussies, so you gotta spoon feed them shit,  hence, decrease the effort and sacrifice

:: [[Side-note]] :: Everyone doesn't have your mindset, college is meant to be used to explore people with newer degrees of dumbness, and figure out methods to sell it to them.

# The Thought Process
- ### The divergent though process
	As a salesman, we have to think of more than one way to sell our offer.

	That is the divergent thinking process. The standard brainwash procedure in school is that, one approach is correct, and all others are wrong, it's either 0 or 1. but, in real life, there are more than one set solution to each and every problem. some of them are right, some of them are wrong, and some of them are more right than the others.
